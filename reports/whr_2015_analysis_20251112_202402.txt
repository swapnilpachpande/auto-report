=== AI-INTERPRETATION ===
Analysis:
- The dataset contains 3 rows and 6 columns.
- There are no missing values in any of the columns.
- The data types include object, int64, and float64.
- The memory usage is very low at 0.00041866302490234375.

Numeric Stats:
- The mean number of survivors is 166.33, with a standard deviation of 43.68.
- The mean number of deaths is 272.33, with a standard deviation of 222.55.
- The mean total count is 438.67, with a standard deviation of 232.38.
- The mean percentage of survivors to total is 43.03%, while the mean percentage of deaths to total is 56.97%.
- The data is skewed towards deaths, with skewness values for deaths and total count being positive.
- There are strong correlations between certain columns, such as a negative correlation of -1.0 between the percentage of survivors and deaths to total, and a positive correlation of 0.98 between deaths and total count.

Categorical Stats:
- The "Class" column has 3 unique values: First, Second, and Third.
- Each class has 1 occurrence in the dataset.
- The column is not binary, as it has more than 2 unique values.
- The entropy of the column is 1.58, indicating some level of randomness or uncertainty in the distribution of values.

Actionable Insights:
- Further investigate the strong correlations between columns, especially between deaths and total count, as well as between deaths and the percentage of survivors and deaths to total.
- Explore the distribution of values within the "Class" column to understand any patterns or trends related to passenger class.
- Consider visualizing the data to gain a better understanding of the relationships between variables and identify any potential outliers or anomalies.
